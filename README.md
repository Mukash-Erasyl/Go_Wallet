This code implements a simple wallet for handling bitcoins in the Go programming language. It begins by defining a custom type, Bitcoin, which is an alias for the float64 type. The Wallet structure represents a wallet, containing two fields: balance and mutex for ensuring safety during concurrent access to the wallet.

The Deposit method allows funds to be added to the wallet.

The Withdraw method allows funds to be withdrawn from the wallet.

The Balance method returns the current balance of the wallet.


wallet_test is a file that allows testing the string reversal code using input-output pairs.
